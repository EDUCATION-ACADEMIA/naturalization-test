<title>Which plan from the 1787 Constiutional Convention called for * Unicameral legislature where every state received equal representation.* Every state would only receive 1 vote
</title>
<meta name="description" content="William Patersons New Jersey Plan proposed a unicameral (one-house) legislature with equal votes of states and an executive elected by a national legislature.In response, William Paterson proposed what became known as the New Jersey Plan, presenting it to the Convention on June 15. The centerpiece of Patersons plan was a unicameral (one-house) legislature in which each state had a single vote.Introduced to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, James Madisons Virginia Plan outlined a strong national government with three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The plan called for a legislature divided into two bodies (the Senate and the House of Representatives) with proportional representation.He is probably best known, however, as the author of The Small State Plan, alternately called The New Jersey Plan or The Paterson Plan, proposed on June 15, 1787. The document was a response to the Virginia Plan, which would have given proportional power to the states based on their number of citizens.Only one: Nebraska has the only unicameral legislature in the country. Since Nebraskas legislature only has one house, it also has the smallest legislative branch in the country-49 senators.">
