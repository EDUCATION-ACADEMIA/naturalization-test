<strong>Concept note-1:

A citizen in a Greek city-state was entitled to vote and was liable to taxation and military service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Athenian definition of “citizens” was also different from modern-day citizens: only free men were considered citizens in Athens.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The origin of citizenship can be traced back to Ancient Greece, when “citizens” were those who had a legal right to participate in the affairs of the state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Not everyone in Athens was considered a citizen. Only free, adult men enjoyed the rights and responsibility of citizenship. Only about 20 percent of the population of Athens were citizens. Women were not citizens and therefore could not vote or have any say in the political process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Greek idea of democracy was different from present-day democracy because, in Athens, all adult citizens were required to take an active part in the government. If they did not fulfill their duty they would be fined and sometimes marked with red paint.
