<strong> How does the Naturalization Process impact the Political Process? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Naturalized citizens influence the political process by arguing and competing for rights to be in charge of the entire country and the whole political process. 
</p>
<p>(B) Naturalized citizens are unable to influence the political process because they have not finished the process to become a full citizen which grants them the rights to impact the political process. 
</p>
<p>(C) Naturalized citizens are unable to influence the political process because there are not enough naturalized citizens in the country to actually make a difference. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Naturalized citizens influence the political process by voting, running for office, being selected for public office, and participating in lawmaking.
