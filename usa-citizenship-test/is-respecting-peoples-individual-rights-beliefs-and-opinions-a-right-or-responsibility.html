<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A right is a choice to make your own opinion and entitlement to things such as education, religion and freedom of speech. Responsibilities are duties or something an individual should do such as following the law and rules. In this sense, classroom roles and responsibilities go hand in hand with each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A personâ€™s ability to enjoy their human rights depends on other people respecting those rights.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-All people have a responsibility to protect the air, water and soil of the earth for the sake of present inhabitants and future generations.
