<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Under the 14th Amendment’s Naturalization Clause and the Supreme Court case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 US. 649, anyone born on U.S. soil and subject to its jurisdiction is a natural born citizen, regardless of parental citizenship.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Birth in one of the outlying possessions of the United States confers U.S. nationality but not citizenship. Like permanent residents, non-citizen U.S. nationals may work and reside anywhere in the country, but may not vote in state or federal elections.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If you are a U.S. citizen (or non-citizen national) and have a child overseas, you should report their birth at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate as soon as possible so that a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) can be issued as an official record of the child’s claim to U.S. citizenship or nationality.

<strong>Concept note-4:

<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Unlawfully registering to vote in a local, state or federal election; claiming to be a citizen on a student loan or passport application, or claiming that one is a citizen to obtain a federally backed mortgage such as FHA loans are common false claim grounds.
