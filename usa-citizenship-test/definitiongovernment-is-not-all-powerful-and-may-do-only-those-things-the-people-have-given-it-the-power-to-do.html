<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The power of the government gets limited by regular elections. Elections are usually held once in five years. Once elected, governments can stay in power only for that period. If they want to continue to be in power then they have to be re-elected by the people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Limited government is defined as a political structure where laws limit the powers of the government to avoid abuse. Democracy is a significant example of a limited government where the power is distributed across the cabinet. It also restricts a single person from wielding excessive influence in decision making.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Constitutional government is by definition limited government. It means government conducted according to rules and principles, which are binding on all political actors, and which therefore help to constrain the unfettered exercise of power by separating or dividing it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Locke’s limited government can be defined as one in which “a morally legitimate government coerces only those who freely and voluntarily consent to its authority” (Locke on Government, Arneson). Therefore, in Locke’s theory of politics, a government can only work if its people are consenting.
